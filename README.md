## File Descriptions

To run this project, you can download this repository and upload in Google Colab or your code editor.

## Model Descriptions
The model we use is K-Means from Sklearn cluster. Using the elbow method to determine the number of clusters that have good insertion. The K value that is obtained will do clustering by calculating the silhouette value.
